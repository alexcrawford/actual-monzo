# Feature Specification: Transaction Import

**Feature Branch**: `003-transaction-import`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "transaction import"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: users, import transactions, Monzo API, Actual Budget
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: fetch transactions from Monzo, import to Actual Budget
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: When a user runs the import command without specifying dates, what should the default date range be? ‚Üí A: Last 30 days from today
- Q: How should the Monzo-to-Actual Budget account mapping be configured? ‚Üí A: During initial setup (setup command prompts for account pairs)
- Q: How should pending (unsettled) transactions be handled during import? ‚Üí A: Import immediately (treat same as settled transactions)
- Q: Should declined transactions be imported or filtered out? ‚Üí A: Filter out (exclude declined transactions entirely)
- Q: When one account import fails but others succeed, how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Continue with successful accounts, report failures at end

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user who has already configured their Monzo account connection wants to retrieve their recent transactions from Monzo and add them to their Actual Budget. They need a simple command to fetch transactions for a specific date range and import them into the correct Actual Budget account, avoiding duplicates if the command is run multiple times.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed setup with valid Monzo credentials and Actual Budget connection, **When** they run the import command for a specific date range, **Then** all transactions from their Monzo account(s) within that range are imported to the corresponding Actual Budget account(s)

2. **Given** transactions already exist in Actual Budget from a previous import, **When** the user runs the import command again with an overlapping date range, **Then** duplicate transactions are not created

3. **Given** a user has multiple Monzo accounts (e.g., current account and joint account), **When** they run the import command, **Then** transactions from all configured accounts are imported to their respective Actual Budget accounts

4. **Given** a user's access token has expired, **When** they attempt to import transactions, **Then** the system prompts them to re-authenticate or provides clear guidance on refreshing their token

5. **Given** a user runs the import without specifying a date range, **When** the command executes, **Then** transactions from the last 30 days are imported

6. **Given** a user has configured account mappings during setup, **When** they run the import command, **Then** transactions are routed to the correct Actual Budget accounts according to the configured mappings

7. **Given** a Monzo account has both pending and settled transactions, **When** the import runs, **Then** both pending and settled transactions are imported without differentiation

8. **Given** a Monzo account has declined transactions within the date range, **When** the import runs, **Then** declined transactions are excluded from the import

9. **Given** a user has multiple accounts and one account fails during import, **When** the import completes, **Then** successful accounts have their transactions imported and failures are reported at the end

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Monzo API is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does system handle transactions with no matching Actual Budget account?
- What if transaction amounts or descriptions contain unusual characters or formats?
- What happens when network connection is lost mid-import?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve transactions from all configured Monzo accounts for a user-specified date range
- **FR-001a**: System MUST default to the last 30 days from today when no date range is specified
- **FR-002**: System MUST map each Monzo account to its corresponding Actual Budget account using mappings configured during the setup command
- **FR-002a**: Setup command MUST prompt users to create account mappings between each Monzo account and an Actual Budget account
- **FR-002b**: System MUST persist account mappings in configuration for use during import
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and skip duplicate transactions when importing to avoid creating duplicates in Actual Budget
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve transaction details including date, amount, merchant/description, and category [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should Monzo categories map to Actual Budget categories automatically?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle authentication token expiry gracefully and provide clear user guidance
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that required configuration exists before attempting import
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide progress indication during import [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is batch size or performance target specified?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST report import results including successful imports, skipped duplicates, and any errors
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to specify start and end dates for the import range
- **FR-010**: System MUST continue importing from successful accounts when one account fails, and report all failures at completion
- **FR-011**: System MUST process transaction amounts correctly, preserving sign (debits vs credits) and currency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how are multi-currency transactions handled?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST import both pending and settled transactions, treating them identically
- **FR-013**: System MUST exclude declined transactions from import

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transaction**: A financial transaction from Monzo with attributes including date, amount, description/merchant, category, status (pending/settled/declined), and account identifier; both pending and settled transactions are imported, declined transactions are excluded
- **Account Mapping**: Association between a Monzo account and an Actual Budget account, configured during setup and persisted in configuration, enabling transactions to be imported to the correct destination
- **Import Session**: A single execution of the import command, tracking the date range, accounts processed, transactions imported, and any errors encountered; continues processing all accounts even when individual account failures occur
- **Date Range**: The time period for which transactions should be fetched, with start and end boundaries; defaults to last 30 days when not specified
